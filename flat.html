<div class="blurb">

  Ah, yes, the Flat Keanu project. An offshoot of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Stanley">Flat Stanley project</a>.

  In a nutshell, it's a reference to a children's book about a character named Stanley and how he was flattened. Stanley used this to his advantage

  by doing things that only flat people could do, and one of the things he did was mail himself to other places in an envelope, which many children have done IRL.

  It's very wholesome :) I decided to do something similar (but more for entertainment) and bring along *Flat Keanu*, with a cut-out of Keanu Reeves 

  bench and eating a sandwich alone, also dubbed <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sad-keanu">*Sad Keanu*</a>

  Pictures to come!
