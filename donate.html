Thanks for wanting to donate!
  </p>
  <p>
  My site does not require much to run- it's hosted on Github Pages (for free) and domain registration is about $10 a year.
</p>
  
  <p>
  Therefore, at this time I am not accepting donations, however, if you really would like to donate to me, donate to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tinybirdgames"> friend's cause</a>, TinyBird Games, instead!
  </p>
