	Thanks for wanting to donate!
  
  My site does not require much to run- it's hosted on Github Pages (for free) and domain registration is about $10 a year.
<br>  
  Therefore, at this time I am not accepting donations, however, if you really would like to donate to me, donate to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tinybirdgames"> friend's cause </a>, TinyBird Games instead!
  <br>
  Some info about TinyBird Games:
  <p>
  TinyBird is an international small indie game dev based in Brazil. 
  Started in july of 2016, our mission is to give opportunities to people from the LGBTQA community by providing a safe work
  environment and raising awareness to the general public.

  We intend to support the LGBTQA community by providing jobs to their members,
  although intermittent freelance work, we can introduce them to a safe environment
  where they can start to learn and/or support themselves.
  </p>
  
  Thanks for the consideration!
