It's that time of year again when all the students return to school, to start another year of educational fun and hopefully satisfy
whatever goal it is they are trying to meet.

While it may be back to business as usual for most students, I couldn't help but think about those starting university/college for
the first time- especially when a friend* excitedly told me about his triumphant entry into post-secondary education after completing
high school several years prior.

My initial reaction was, "Awesome! I'm very happy for you", with a follow-up question of, "Are you attending orientation week?"


...To which I received a, "no".

I was heartbroken.

My excitement behind that question was dashed. I felt a sort of sadness for him. All because of the experiences I had during my orientation
before starting my first year of university.
