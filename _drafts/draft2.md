It's that time of year again when all the students return to school, to start another year of educational fun and hopefully satisfy
whatever goal it is they are trying to meet.

Of course, you- my dear reader- may not be a student anymore, but your child or friend's children may be a student so this article might be of interest to you. It may also make you think!

While it may be back to business as usual for most students, I couldn't help but think about those starting university/college for
the first time- especially when a friend* excitedly told me about his triumphant entry into post-secondary education after completing
high school several years prior.

My initial reaction was, "Awesome! I'm very happy for you", with a follow-up question of, "Are you attending orientation week?"


...To which I received a, "no".

I was heartbroken.

My excitement behind that question was dashed. I felt a sort of sadness for him. It could be partly due to the experiences I had during my orientation before starting my first year of university.

The main points I want to touch upon include: friendship, networking opportunities, team/character-building, and fun.


**Friendship**

Things are usually more fun with friends- watching a movie, eating at a restaurant, playing Mario Kart- school is no different. I noticed during my first orientation week that people are less on edge than the rest of the school year, which makes sense as students wouldn't be bombarded or preoccupied by tests, labs, assignments, practice questions, or exams. Granted, there are other pressures such as figuring out if they'll get into the course they want, nervousness at whether or not they'll do well or pass in the upcoming year, or strange orientation schedules and other things, but I think orientation is the best way to make friends in post-secondary as this is *probably one of the few times students will be able to be themselves and not nose-deep in notes/courses*.

Some of the contacts I made during orientation still keep in touch with me, and for better or for worse, I think orientation is a great way to make lifelong connections.


**Networking**

To segue from friendship would be networking. While some people may not call acquaintanceship as "friendship", perhaps the contacts a student might make could fall under the "networking" camp. 

I believe orientation is, without a doubt, a great way to make new contacts. Since orientation is a great time to meet people during a period when they're "themselves" or a little less tense, I got the chance to meet people for who they really are, or who they are outside of school. I did meet a few interesting characters, to put it lightly.

These contacts that a student might make may ultimately be the people that would help them through school, provide moral support, or even find them a job. Of course, it's not 


**Character Building**


**Fun!**
