It's interesting how a comic from 17 years ago is still relevant today: Servers and networks that can be brought down to a halt by anyone with a computer connected to the Internet- whether old, young, or in between, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are still real and a menace to networks and the Internet as a whole. 

Casually going through the first page of a *DuckDuckGo* search on DDoS attacks in the past month will reveal that DDoS attacks are still around and may have financial, legal, and business repercussions.

As noted in the screenshot, a couple of the results are related to DDoS attacks using IoT, a news site, *Al Jazeera*, and DdoS attacks on Bitcoin merchants.

These results underline the reality of today's situation. From the top results, I can see that cybercriminals are using any means necessary to disrupt network traffic to news outlets or financial services. With the advent of Internet-connected devices, or the Internet of Things (IoT), many of such devices are left vulnerable as security is mainly an afterthought by their creators, and thus can be used as part of botnets to carry out attacks on the attacker's targets.

So why are DDoS attacks so prevalent in our culture, and why do people it?

Why do 
  

Whether or not it's seen as a game to certain people, as long as the venture is seen as profitable... The threat is real, and no end is in sight.
