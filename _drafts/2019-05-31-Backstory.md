title: Behind the Scenes: How'd I get Here?

Earlier this week, I attended a cybersecurity forum called [TASK](https://www.task.to).

"What is TASK?", you might ask? It's a meetup of cybersecurity professionals and anyone interested in the field where 2 speakers would

present their findings or a topic related to information security they are passionate about.

I've been to a couple talks in the past (think about 2 years ago) but haven't been to many in the past year and a half.

So what changed?

I got a NEW JOB! (Okay I didn't mean for the caps lock but I accidentally hit it and I felt it was apt enough to leave it.)


After working in a SOC for about 3 years I've decided it was time for a shift in responsibilities and to

get out there and learn new things.

Funny enough, every time I'd introduce myself and tell someone in the information security industry I've worked in

a SOC for 3 years they are either:

<p>
- Taken aback.
- Surprised.
- Impressed.
</p>


Why? One of the main theories is high level of burnout due to varying factors, the main one being dealing with

false positives. Those were the bane of my existence, hah! According to a news article I read about SOC turnover and 

A talk by Alissa Torres ([PDF](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-summit/archives/file/summit-archive-1532967606.pdf))

entitled, "Give your SOC a SOUL", I can totally relate the content of the talk to my experiences in a SOC, and how burnt out and unmotivated I felt

after being there for a few years.


It took me about 2 years to find the next job. It was something of a fairly long and passive search.

I've gone through a handful of in-person and over-the-phone interviews.

At one point during job consideration I went on a little adventure to another province (flight included!) 

and checked out a city I haven't been to before.
