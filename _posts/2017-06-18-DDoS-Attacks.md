It's interesting how a comic from 17 years ago is still relevant today: Servers and networks that can be brought down to a halt by anyone with a computer connected to the Internet- whether old, young, or in between, Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are still real and a menace to networks and the Internet as a whole. 

Casually going through the first page of a *DuckDuckGo* search on DDoS attacks in the past month will reveal that DDoS attacks are still around and may have financial, legal, and business repercussions.

As noted in the screenshot, a couple of the results are related to DDoS attacks using IoT, a news site, *Al Jazeera*, and DdoS attacks on Bitcoin merchants.

These results underline the reality of today's situation. From the top results, I can see that cybercriminals are using any means necessary to disrupt network traffic to news outlets or financial services. With the advent of Internet-connected devices, or the Internet of Things (IoT), many of such devices are left vulnerable as security is mainly an afterthought by their creators, and thus can be used as part of botnets to carry out attacks on the attacker's targets.

So why are DDoS attacks so prevalent in our culture, and why do people it?

Why do we allow people to launch attacks like this in the first place?

I'll tell you right now- money and regulation.


<h3> Money </h3>

Imagine you're walking down the street in a eastern European country, for example.
You've had a hard day at work- your boss yelling at you all day for being "incompetent", and your coworkers shunning you because you are "too hard of a worker" and "make them look bad"- you just want to get home.

You barely make ends meet. You think about what you'll be doing at home- what you'll eat for dinner, what treat you'll give your pet as Humphrey's been a little sick of the regular food you've been feeding it.

Your thoughts are muddled when some character on the street bumps into you. He wants your attention.

You look up, it's a partially clean-shaven man with disheveled hair. 

He offers you a task. For money. A relatively simple task.

*Open up a few programs on your computer and click on a few menus and enter in these numbers. Once you're done, let it run for a few hours and send us screenshots of the work and you will see the money in your account.*

What the average user wouldn't know is that they're being paid to engage in a DOS attack- a kind of attack that has the potential to deny legitimate users from making connections to resources they are entitled to make.

Scale this attack up to tens, if not hundreds of thousands of devices and computers and you have a massive array of machines that have the ability to bring down even the biggest networks.

Of course, there are ways to mitigate these attacks in the form of DDoS protection such as [*Akamai*'s Kona Site Defender](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/products/cloud-security/kona-site-defender.jsp) or [*Cloudflare*'s DDoS protection](https://www.cloudflare.com/ddos/), which "**have successfully mitigated attacks bigger than 400Gbps.**"

"People pay for this stuff?" is what an average computer user would ask.

Granted, the dream a lot of us have involves making it big, having a sizeable house of our own, (possibly) married with kids and more money-than-you-can-shake-a-stick at in the bank. While most of us are engaged in perfectly legal methods of making money, some resort to less-than-savoury ideals, and may get caught- such as [Krebs on Security's article](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/04/the-backstory-behind-carder-kingpin-roman-seleznevs-record-27-year-prison-sentence/) or [this article](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/flashy-cars-got-spam-kingpin-mugged/). The articles I linked is more on the extreme side of cybercrime- but the grunts on the very bottom of the foodchain may be your regular person just trying to make a living. Not being able to put food on the table each day may be a huge motivator for some people driven to commit crime, and cybercrime is no different, especially when people are acting being proxies or using ways to hide their tracks.

<h3> Regulations and Laws </h3>

Less developed nations (such as those in eastern Europe) may not be able to catch up with the advances made in Internet technology, which leaves those countries rife for issues in being able to curb cybercrime. 

Paolo Sartori, a senior Italian police investigator speaking to the [Washington Free Beacon](http://freebeacon.com/national-security/interpol-cyber-crime-from-russia-e-europe-expands/), states that "The way cyber crime has changed criminality is the biggest challenge for us. It is a huge challenge to face this criminal phenomenon," where "Cyber crime originating from Russia and Eastern Europe is increasing in both scale and sophistication"

Coupled with the fact of the lack of resources to deal with the issue and with the prospect with being able to own say, a Porsche Cayenne, then it may seem like a good idea to deny poor old Ben from being able to access his work computer via a VPN tunnel. Of course, this is a bit of an exaggeration- those on the bottom of the cybercrime industry typically do not have the means to make a *serious* (to the tune of millions) amount of money, but those that have the knowledge and charisma may certainly do so.

A consequence of lack of law enforcement or regulations is what drives some people to crime- the lack of jobs. In the Free Beacon link, 

> The region also has a large pool of people with very advanced information technology skills. Cyber criminals "are very well prepared and very well motivated," Sartori said, noting that some arrests involved catching hackers at universities who were on the way to take exams.

> In Russia, the lack of legitimate high-tech jobs is another cause for increased cyber crime rates.

> "In Russia and other former Soviet Union and Eastern European economies, top university graduates are reportedly paid by organized crimes up to **10 times** more than from legitimate jobs," he said.

With the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) that allow items such as everyday household appliances to become *Internet enabled*, they become a potential target for threat actors to wreck havok using these appliances to launch attacks against corporations or entities for money.

<h3> Afterthought </h3>

The potential risk to reward ratio of engaging in cybercrime, whether through DDoS attacks or malware attacks, is seen as attractive to people who are unable to find a job or get money- as there are many safeguards one can use to mask or hide the criminal's traces, the reward would be perceived as high(er) where the risk is low. Until it is possible to reduce the reward and increase the risk, cybercrime will continue to be perceived as a very successful industry to engage in certain parts of the world.

Whether or not it's seen as a game to certain people, as long as the venture is seen as profitable... The threat is real, and no end is in sight.
