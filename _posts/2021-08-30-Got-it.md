Hi! It definitely has been a while since I last put up a post. So much has happened since then... I took up Astronomy, learned how to camp and went camping, went on a bunch of cottage trips, and a trip to Florida with my partner (weeks before the pandemic was declared a pandemic)!

Wow.

It has been a while.

The biggest thing that's happened to me since is *provisionally* passing the Certified Cloud Security Professional (CCSP) exam earlier today!

This is big to me because I haven't written an IT exam in a little over 3 years so I felt really rusty. Now, that's not to say I'm not current with the information security industry- in the last 3 years I tried to keep up with the times by the following:
- Reading a [daily digest](https://www.thecyberwire.com/newsletters/daily-briefing)
- Attend a couple conferences both [online](https://hope.net/) and [in-person](https://layer8conference.com/)
- Participate in a [handful](https://hakin9.org/hacky-easter/) [of](https://holidayhackchallenge.com/) [CTFs](https://www.tracelabs.org/) (capture the flag tournaments) 
- Provide guidance to beginners in the industry. 

My day job as well!

<h2> About the Exam </h2>

The [CCSP exam](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CCSP) is mainly about the cloud and securing it. In my opinion the certification is more about breadth than depth. It goes over a cursory treatment of various aspects of cloud security, although there is still a fair amount of technical bits in the exam content that's tested.

This exam requires the candidate to have 5+ years of IT-related experience and having less will grant the associate of (ISC)² but thankfully I have the required experience! Just need to get an endorsement from someone with an active (ISC)² certification. I know a person or two :)

In the chat forums (a Discord server called "Certification Station (CS)") I frequent there is a bit of chatter from people creating posts either on blogs, Medium or otherwise detailing their exam experience and their advice on how to succeed. This post will try to illustrate just that- that's not to say my next post is going to be about how my next cert will go, I actually was planning/in the middle of writing other blog posts but never got around to completing them. Hopefully I get around to it!


<h2> What was my Motivation for Taking this Exam? </h2>
My CompTIA PenTest+ certification was expiring (earlier in April this year) so I needed to pull myself up by my bootstraps and find ways to renew it via CEUs (Continuing Education Units). The CCSP training course on A Cloud Guru (ACG)/Linux Academy was just what I needed- close to 22 hours of content with a couple hands-on labs with AWS (Amazon Web Services). I also looked at a couple Cybrary courses and realized some conferences I attended counted towards it too (although going to 5 conferences was a bit overkill. 1-2 was enough). 

What was my main motivation for taking the CCSP exam? I did the ACG/Linux Academy training course and thought that I might as well go for it since I already went through all the material. Plus, I currently work with the cloud in my day-to-day job function so I might as well go for a certification that proves I know my stuff! I think this cert also serves as a good jumping point to going for the more vendor-specific certifications like Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Microsoft Azure, or AWS.


<h2> How'd I do on the Exam? </h2>

To be honest, I went in with a blend of optimism and pessimism. Since the exam centre near me (about 5 min away) was not letting people write exams because of COVID-19 and because of that my exam was rescheduled twice delaying my exam date by about 2 months. I had to drive almost an hour away to write my exam. I also didn't realize until an hour prior to heading out that parking at the site was not free, haha. But I digress. 

Fueled on 4-5 hours of sleep, a cocktail of a breakfast consisting of a hot dog, borderline edible cereal that's been left out for a while, and a sip or two of piping hot black camomille tea, I went into that exam and did the best I could for each question. It wasn't too helpful that all (ISC)² exams do not let you mark/flag questions for review and go back to them later. Once you lock in a question, that's it. There is no going back. I suppose this was partly good for my sanity because I can be fairly indecisive at times with exam questions, so I took a bit more time than usual for each question to make darn sure I was confident with my answer. They also included a mini legal-sized whiteboard you could mark up. I made sure to write all the things on there, including keywords from some trickier questions, regulations and frameworks that I remembered off the top of my head. I even drew a stick figure diagram to assist me in answering a question at one point. Make sure to use the whiteboard provided!

It was all multiple choice with no long answer or practical questions. At certain points on the exam I thought I wasn't going to pass. It felt like a slog going through most of the scenario questions. There were a lot of questions that didn't seem obvious at first, as a lot of them were scenario-based questions that build on top of the content I went through in the study guides and answers were twisted around with some seemingly similar phrases/words, with a couple straightforward knowledge questions. In essence, the exam took me back to my uni days where all the exams were exactly like this. I'll put it out there that this is, if not, one of the harder IT exams I've written. 

The exam length is 3 hours (180 minutes) which I had about 1.75 minutes for each question. Eventually I ended the exam with about 45 minutes left because I had to use the bathroom.


<h2> Exam advice - Theory </h2>

This exam is not to be taken lightly. It tests thoroughly on all 6 domains of the Cloud set out by their outline. As well as the frameworks, forensics, electronic discovery, laws and regulations, make sure you know your security stuff, both cloud and non-cloud. 

In terms of my studying regimen, I spent about an hour each night about a month leading up to the scheduled exam. When the exam got rescheduled, there was a bit of a lull but I'd get back into it about a month prior to the next rescheduled date. I made sure to go through the Official Study Guide (OSG) from cover to cover.
These are the resources I tapped into: 
- Official Study Guide + Practice questions by Ben Malisow (be sure to access the online version of the practice questions! Saves a lot of headache.)
- The Certification Station (CS) Discord server
- Adam Gordon's CCSP bootcamp + notes
- Linux Academy/A Cloud Guru CCSP training course
- Gwen Bettwy's presentation on "Thinking Like A Manager"
- Gwen Bettwy's Dropbox folder of notes
- Occasional quiz questions from people in the CS Discord server
- Notes I took from the OSG and lots of practice questions from the ACG course/practice questions book
- My head noodle containing all the IT work experience and knowledge I've accumulated from studying the CompTIA certs

Speaking of the presentation on thinking like a manager, I thought it was great and mighty helpful. Having been an individual contributor my whole career so far, it gave me a lot of insight into the mind of a person in a supervisory position. I felt that adopting a managerial mindset like thinking about cost-benefit and the people/employees on the exam gave me an edge.

Here are the highlights of the notes I took from her presentation:
- "Spend money wisely, hire the right people, right processes and technologies"
- "(ISC)² is looking for the best managerial answer"
- "Managers should have an idea of the technology so they can talk to the technical people to make the decisions they need to make"
- Always think about the people - always take life safety answers
- LIFE SAFETY, PEOPLE, PROCESS -> people come first, then process -> look for order of answers

Definitely approach the exam with these points in mind. It may just give you an edge as well!! :)

Also, applicable to not just the CCSP, write down notes while you are studying and put them up on a wall where you study. Be it regulations or frameworks, writing things down will [improve your recall of those topics](https://redbooth.com/blog/handwriting-and-memory). 

<h2> Exam advice - Physical </h2>

Pace yourself on the exam as well. You get between one and a half to two minutes for each question- since some questions will be easier or trickier than others, do not panic. Just be sure to give yourself some time for a mini break as well. Close your eyes, look away from the computer screen every so often. The questions will still be there when you get back to it in a minute. If you are like me, your back might start feeling uncomfortable after about 1-2 hours of sitting, so make sure to move around a bit on your chair or even ask to use the bathroom. 

The problem with using the bathroom was that:
- Once you exit the exam room, they ask for ID and a palm scan.
- You use the bathroom, that's great!
- When you come back you are asked to provide your ID and palm scan.
- You also need to do a self-pat down of your shoulders, arms, torso, and legs.

Do you see what I'm getting at? This can take up to about 5 minutes off your exam time.

Don't sit in the same position for too long. Hydrate (and take your vitamins) before taking the exam but don't drink too much that you absolutely need the bathroom halfway through. 

Use the provided noise-cancelling headsets if you need it. Depending on the exam centre it may be noisy like mine- the proctors kept walking in and out and I was situated beside a bunch of people divided by short cubicle walls. This didn't bother me, but it should be something to note if you are looking for a quiet environment to write your exam.

<h2> Parting Thoughts </h2>

I wasn't quite sure what I got myself into when I decided to go for this certification. Actually, I was going to go for the OSCP but I had some objections to their registration process. But hey, I didn't think I could do it, but I did it. I went on a concerted effort to study and got a positive result. I'm over the moon!

All in all, this marks certification #7 (once I get through the endorsement process)!
