**Note**: Nothing in this post constitutes legal advice, nor should it be taken as a single source of truth. Do your research!

Executive summary: Earlier last month I obtained TN status!!! It's basically work authorization that allows me to work in the US.

To start off I want to include some tips and tricks for getting on the other side of the interview with great success. This is from the perspective of myself, a Canadian IT worker. My personal story follows.

<h1> Tips on getting approved for TN status </h1>

**Getting all your paperwork in order**:
- Have the conversation as early as possible with your prospective employer that you need work authorization to work in the US via TN status and if they can draft a support letter if you get hired. I would bring it up with the recruiter during the initial phone screen to ensure there are no issues with work authorization when getting the offer letter. Getting TN status arguably requires the least work compared to work visas to get into the US.
- Be sure to get both an offer letter and support letter from your prospective employer in hand, signed in wet ink. 
- Make sure the offer letter and support letter has the company's letterhead with US addresses.
- Figure out which [TN category](https://visaservices.duke.edu/categories/tn/profession-list) you're applying for, and make sure your support letter includes a job description that aligns with the category you're applying to.
- Graduate credentials like a graduate certificate, master's degree, or PHD are not required depending on which category you apply to. Most of the categories require a bachelor's degree.
- If your TN category calls for it, you will absolutely need your original bachelor's degree. A copy will not suffice (based on what I've read), and the associated university transcript.
- Be sure you have US$50 on your credit or debit card. CBP doesn't seem to take cash, but have cash with you anyway in case the card reader is not working.

**Preparation**:
- Look at various online resources and forum posts. You are probably not alone since many people apply for TN status every year. You may be able to find someone with a similar background and experience to yours that I might not cover during this post!
- Make sure to have all the documents listed above with you. Before heading out to the POE keep a list of all the things you need to bring (this list is non-exhaustive and may vary depending on your situation):

1) Offer and support letters from the prospective employer

2) Bachelor's degree (or other required credential(s) according to the TN category requirements)

3) University or college transcript, if applicable (usually required)

4) Credential evaluation or translation, if applicable, and your degree was not granted in North America.

5) Knowledge of where you'll be staying if you have a place to stay in the US lined up

6) Any proof of ties you have to your home country (e.g., bank account statements, credit cards, retirement contributions, astronomy membership)

**Miscellaneous**:
- If you have a NEXUS card you're able to use the NEXUS line at an airport. Just go straight to the agent and tell them you're applying for TN status. I'm not sure about a land Port of Entry (POE) with NEXUS, but it might help to call ahead and ask, which leads to my next point.
- If you have any questions you may directly contact the POE you intend to do the interview at and speak to an agent. Some POEs may require an appointment. The agents are nice and helpful!

**Interview day**:
- Dress the part. You're going to an interview! I'd keep it semi-formal. I wore a blazer on top of a blouse with darker jeans and low-heel pumps.
- Get enough rest the previous night (this may be hard)
- Eat a good breakfast (not 3 chocolate bars). Stay hydrated. Take your vitamins.
- Take your time with answering the interview questions. Ask to repeat or clarify if you are not sure about a question.
- Depending on which airport or POE you cross, you may be required to stand at a counter for the duration of the interview (I stood against a counter at the Calgary POE)
- The interview can take anywhere from half an hour to 3+ hours (it took about 45 minutes for me)

<h2> Relevant qualifications about me </h2>
1) Hold a degree in Computing specializing in Cognitive Science

2) Been in the cybersecurity field for 5-10 years

3) My "new" role has to do with cloud security and development ("developer" is in the title), it's the same role as what I had for about 3.5 years, just as a US employee.

4) I applied for the "Computer Systems Analyst" TN category and not "Engineer" category despite some of my role being related to software engineering. More on this in my story.

Honestly a relevant degree, university transcript, offer letter, and support letter is all I needed!

It's also possible to get a TN as a recent graduate with minimal experience as long as an employer is willing to put in the work to get you an offer letter and support letter.


<h1> Storytime </h1>
The following is based on real-life events and details my experiences with obtaining TN status.

<h2> Intro </h2>

This is a culmination of a year+ of planning, perserverence, and hard work.
It also happened by accident.

"Wait, you planned this out by accident?"

Yes, it was all an accident.
I originally did not intend on getting TN status, but here we are.

Initially I planned on a ~6 month visit to have fun and work remotely in the US with my fiancé, but it turns out HR at my company was not too pleased by this plan when they found out. I did clear it with my boss beforehand which I thought HR also knew but they didn't. Instead of 6 months, I only had 6 weeks to work internationally per their rules.

The exchange between myself and HR went like, "Do you have work authorization?" "No, but I understand that as a Canadian citizen I should be able to work remotely up to 6 months visa-free"

Haha, nope!

Why 6 months? That is the amount of time I can stay in the US visa-free as a Canadian tourist. I was going to plan to work remotely while visiting.

So I panicked. Got really stressed out. What was I to do? 


<h2> Action Plan </h2>

After I was done panicking I explored 3 options:

1) Officially move to Alberta and stay there for about 6 months, then come down again to see my fiancé. Repeat.

2) Pursue higher education to get a study visa so I can stay longer

3) Quit my job and find another that offers sponsorship


I first explored option 1 and started looking at rentals in Alberta. That was actually what I was planning on doing after my 6-month stay in the US, just that instead of looking closer to the end of the 6 month period I was looking after 4 weeks. Prior to my roadtrip down from Ontario to Arizona, I packed everything up and put it all in a shipping container. To this day, I am still shelling out a little over US$100 a month to have it stored in a warehouse in Ontario :D

The rent in Alberta seemed fairly reasonable, and I was thinking of doing something like going up for about 6 months and then coming back down for another 6 months to enjoy the sweet, sweet Arizona heat. Basically I'd be one of the many Canadian snowbirds that flock down to the south during the winter for nice, moderate temperatures.

Option 2) for higher education was also considered, but it was already September when the news broke that I couldn't stay more than 6 weeks, so I would have needed to return to my home country either way so I could continue working. I'd be shooting for a start date of January, and I did see a couple cool programs at Arizona State University and Maricopa College.

However, my grades weren't the best. Plus all the programs would not look at my graduate certificate grades (which I did way stellar compared to my bachelor's).

Option 3 wasn't in the cards because before the thought of finding employment elsewhere was put in my head, my boss and HR came up with the idea of potentially getting me work authorization.


<h2> Lots of waiting </h2>

When the news broke that I could potentially get work authorization to become a US employee, I was floored. Very excited. My boss told me he would bring it up with upper management to get sign-off and the like.

The whole process took about 2-3 weeks and I gotta tell you, it was a very stressful couple weeks as I wasn't sure of what my fate would be. While I waited I continued working until the end of September, which was the deadline of how long I could work remotely from an international location. Afterward, I'd be expected back in Canada to either continue working remotely or from the office in Ontario.

I was filled with many emotions- mainly dread because I did not want to go back that soon. My fiancé rented out an apartment and I wanted to stay with him for the next couple months.

<h2> More waiting </h2>

In response to the news that I could only stay and work remotely in the US for 6 weeks, I made an agreement with my boss and HR to take time off. 
I agreed to take 2 weeks of paid time-off and 2 weeks unpaid.

Eventually, I was approved by upper management and had sign-offs from all the right people, so the next step was to wait for documentation. The time off I took was so I could stay in Arizona a bit longer while I get all the appropriate documents from my company for work authorization.

In this case, work authorization comes in the form of getting a support letter and offer letter from my company, nothing else. These two documents are instrumental in obtaining [TN status](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/tn-nafta-professionals), which is a non-immigration status that is granted to skilled professionals in Canada, US, and Mexico to work in either of these countries. It differs from a work visa in the sense that the person with this status is unable to get permanent residency or citizenship through this path. TN status can also be called a TN visa, but I believe that wording is mainly for Mexican nationals who want to work in the US as they have to go through a process to obtain a visa stamp, while a Canadian seeking TN does not get a visa, but a stamp indicating work authorization (also known as an i-94). More info can be found here for the [differences in applying as either a Mexican citizen or Canadian citizen](https://www.visapro.com/resources/article/tn-nafta-visa-for-mexicans/)

Prior to the waiting period and my time off, I assisted HR with drafting the support letter by providing samples and templates I found on the internet. When it came time to take a "break" I was more or less attached to the hip with the work chat to see if there were any updates, all the while thoughts of whether or not I'd be able to pass the TN status interview hung over my head. 

The thought of having a mean interviewer provoking me to the point of tears, or getting bombarded with very difficult questions, or outright failing the interview... revolved around my head for weeks. I had trouble sleeping, did not want to do things most days- basically wanted to stay at home and do nothing.

With that said, however, I did try to make the most out of my time off.
Here's what I did during the month I was off:
- Made a million new recipies
- Attended two security conferences, SANS Blue Team Summit (Scottsdale, AZ) and Wild West Hackin' Fest (remote)
- Went plane spotting
- Hiked a mountain
- Went to Minnesota to check out a mall and see one of my favourite bands, Voxtrot!
- Went to calgary

I tried to enjoy myself since it was my own personal time off, and I got to spend most of it with my fiancé which was great. I just did not like the negative thoughts hanging over my head about the upcoming interview the whole time.

A part of it may have been my fiancé trying to "coach" me to assume the worst case scenarios during the interview so I become well prepared. I suppose it worked, but all the negativity kind of got to me at every corner of my time off.

<h2> Preparing for the interview </h2>
I didn't need many things to bring with me, but I still brought a couple essentials like a couple days' worth of clothing, my work and personal laptops, personal essentials. I was still assuming the worst case scenario where I might get stranded up in Canada and need to stay up there for a bit. Of course, I could also re-enter the US for tourism but I'd have to explain to my company that I was denied entry, and it was expected that I return to work in Canada at the end of my time off.

In terms of documentation I brought with me:
- My bachelor's degree with transcript
- My graduate certificate (this was not required but I brought it anyway)
- Offer letter
- Support letter
- Proof of ties with home country (e.g., my bank account statements, credit cards, retirement fund information, astronomy membership)

I also called the Calgary Point of Entry to confirm a couple details regarding the interview that I couldn't find online and for my own sanity.
Questions like:
- Do I need an appointment? They answered "no".
- Can I apply for TN status using the NEXUS lines? They answered "yes".
- To save time should I photocopy my degree ahead of time? They answered "no need".

Eventually the day came to fly up to Calgary, Alberta.

The stakes felt high.

<h2> The Night Before the Interview </h2>

I took an easy 3-hour flight to the closest major airport to me- Calgary. I paid for the entire trip out of pocket. One nonrefundable ticket up to Calgary, and a refundable ticket back. Thankfully I had enough reward points to cover the one-night stay at the nearby hotel.

When I landed at the Calgary airport I made sure to get some American currency as some forum posts mentioned to have some in case the the machine didn't work, but thankfully I didn't need it. The exchange rate at the airport was absolutely horrible- to get 35 US dollars cost me almost CA$60! Bleh.

The cheapest next flight home was running the next day. A same day flight would have also been stressful for me, so I opted to stay the night.
It was nice that I was able to order delivery and have it delivered to my hotel room. I got some sushi from a restaurant called Misai Japa Cafe and it was great.

*Can you believe I ate all this that night? I can't either!*

<h2> The Day of the Interview </h2>

When I woke up I was actually not hungry at all, it could have been a combination of all the sushi I had the previous night and the nervousness/anxiety/adrenaline I had in my system with the interview in a few hours. Eventually I did get a bit hungry and well, I skipped the complementary breakfast and had what I call, *the breakfast of champions*.:
![don't eat this for breakfast](/assets/tn_status/breakfastofchampions.jpg)

*I had this for breakfast. Don't do what I did.*

When it came time for the interview I tried to dress the part, see below:
![me in formalwear](/assets/tn_status/me.jpg)

*Dressing the part for an interview*

I then made it to the airport. The shoes I wore were definitely not for walking and every step I took was painful, but the motivation to look the part definitely kept me going. When I got to the airport I walked about 10 minutes the wrong way until I asked somebody and had to walk another 10 back. That was not fun.

After getting to the right gate, past security, and approaching CBP, I entered the Global Entry/NEXUS line and skipped the machines. Remember I called ahead and asked if I could use the trusted traveller lines? Yes, they told me to skip the machines too, which I went straight to an agent.

I gave them my documentation to check and they asked if I used the machines. I told them "no, I am applying for TN status" and immediately I was told to follow a line that led to a series of seats to sit on for the interview.

<h2> Waiting for the Interview </h2>

After about 3 minutes of waiting, myself and another person were escorted by an agent into another area behind automatic doors. It was an open holding area of sorts, with a bathroom and a TV with the Food Network playing. Immediately outside the area was a really open space with a bunch of counters on the other side with agents staffed at almost every booth. I believe there were about 8 counters.

There were signs everywhere saying that I wasn't allowed to use my phone, so I and the other 4 or so people sitting in the same area with me complied.
One of them wore a suit, while the others were in casual clothing. I could imagine since the secondary screening area is also for declaring things you could tell who was there for an interview and who was there for other things.

After about 15 minutes of waiting I was eventually called over to one of the counters...

<h2> The Interview </h2>

The agent had a neutral face. The questions they asked were thorough enough to the point where they got the answers they needed, but not intrusive enough to make me feel like I was put in a hotel room and interrogated with a bright lamp aimed at me for a straight hour (I might blog about this in another life... haha)

The very first thing they asked was for my bachelor's degree. I carefully took it out of a reinforced cardboard tube, unfurled it, and handed it over to them for a copy.

They then proceeded to ask me questions about my offer letter, support letter, and also took my transcript.

One of the first questions they asked was about how I mentioned I was "transferring as a US employee" and didn't see any documentation about a transfer. I elaborated by saying they're basically firing me as a Canadian employee and re-hiring as a US-based employee. They seemed satisfied by this answer.

They also asked questions like:
- "Are you applying for just yourself?"
- "The support letter doesn't mention if you get a different role, will there be any notice? Your TN hinges on this fact." I told them that the company will give me advanced and written notice if I get a new role. They also seemed satisfied by this answer.
- "What category are you applying for?"
- "What are your responsibilities?"
- "What is your manager's name, how long have you known them for?"
- "What is your manager's educational background?"
- "Do you have any direct reports?"
- "Where will you be staying?"

Note that I told them the category I was applying for was the "Computer Systems Analyst" category as the majority of my role involves "analysis of security processes, creating threat detection systems and suggesting improvements to protect our customers from cyberattacks". I told the agent this and they seemed satisfied by my answer. I have read many forum posts to minimize the reference of development tasks, and even though my role has the word "developer" in the title, I would say about 90% of my time at work is spent mentoring, suggesting improvements and optimizations in processes, suggesting changes, documentation, troubleshooting our existing processes and detections. The other 10% would be actual coding, which I stressed was a very small part of my day-to-day.

Heck, I even came up with a breakdown by percentage of my regular tasks:

20% security and threat intelligence research and analysis

20% troubleshooting/investigation tasks

10% implementation in response to troubleshooting and investigation tasks

20% documentation tasks

30% mentorship

The reason why I went with the Computer Systems Analyst category and not Engineer category is because there have been conflicts in the past regarding how "Software Engineering" is not considered under the Engineer category. It is open to interpretation by the individual agent, however, and there have been [guidance about this in historical memos](https://legalservicesincorporated.com/immigration/can-i-get-a-tn-visa-for-it-professional-can-tn-visas-be-issued-for-software-engineers-can-an-it-person-get-a-tn-visa-can-a-hardware-engineer-get-a-tn-visa/) but I didn't want to risk it and when I gave it more thought, felt that the Computer Systems Analyst category closely aligned more with my job: 

"It is quite common for a person to be performing some degree of programming duties, which is something that all computer science and software engineers may do to some extent, even if their core duties revolve around designing software and hardware systems. However, mentioning that programming is part of the job duties may lead to the officer incorrectly classifying the position as a computer programmer job, which is not covered as a TN approved occupation."

After a brief pause they told me to go to the counter at the corner to pay a US$50 fee for the application and then take a seat in the waiting area. 

Eventually they called me up again and gave me back my passport, which had a stamp indicating TN status/work authorization. They also gave me instructions on how to get my i-94 form and handed me a small instructional sheet.

At the end they asked if I had any questions for them. My only question at the time was, "may I use the bathroom" because the stress and anxiety really got to me! I sported a poker face the whole time as that secondary screening area felt like it was only right to have a neutral face the whole time, but I can tell you I was giga elated and a rush of relief washed over me.

(OK I lied- when I answered their questions I tried to be positive in my responses with a smile here and there)

And that was it. I then realized they didn't tell me where the exit was so I got a bit disoriented when I tried to exit where I entered, and had to go up to another agent to ask where the exit was as the person I interviewed with disappeared.

I later went for more sushi that week to celebrate.

*The end result of a multi-month effort*

<h2> Post-TN </h2>

This was one of the more stressful events I've experienced in the last year, and while I got what I needed, there was still quite a bit of work to do ahead of me.

After getting TN status I had a list to do the following:
- Fill out paperwork for my employer
- Change a bunch of old information in the HR system
- Get "onboarded"
- Get my i-94 form fixed (it was not updated when I got TN status and I had to contact CBP which took 3 weeks)
- Get a SSN
- Get a bank account
- Get a credit card
- Get a US driver's license

I must admit as a newcomer to the country it was difficult to do some of these things.
Even as I write this blog I am still waiting on my credit card in the mail.

Was it all worth the effort and stress? Yes.
