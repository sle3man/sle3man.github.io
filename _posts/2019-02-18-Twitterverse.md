Yesterday it occurred to me that a lot of people use Twitter, and found out it is a great way of exchanging and discussing
topics and ideas pertaining to information security and cognitive science, so I thought, "why not" and created another account!

You might be wondering, "wait you created another account?"! Yes, my last account got suspended because I "failed" to verify my account
with a phone number after I tried to use [Twitterfall](https://twitterfall.com/), a site for visualizing and 
obtaining live twitter posts based on keywords you provide.


In regards to infosec, Twitterfall a great way of staying current with the latest trends and issues revolving around the field:

There are also [alternatives to Twitterfall](https://www.topbestalternatives.com/twitterfall/)
 like the Twitter Fountain or TweetBeam.


Who would have thought that it would be necessary to verify with a phone number to let Twitter know you're not a robot?

I suppose with a large social networking site like Twitter, there would be the problem of automated accounts and whatnot.

Despite all this, I eventually made another account and you can follow me here:

When I started following a bunch of people in the infosec industry over a short period of time, this happened:

Silly, silly! I got fed up and verified with a phone number. Apparently you can remove the phone number on file afterwards, though.

I won't be posting or using it too much, but it's definitely a good avenue of interacting with others online and maintaining a good Internet presence!
