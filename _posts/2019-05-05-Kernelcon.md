Last month, I went on another plane to Omaha, Nebraska, USA to attend [Kernelcon](https://kernelcon.org)!

OK. Now I don't want to turn this blog into a giant blurb about the cons I've been to, but I'm willing to make an exception 
because of how awesome this one was!!

You may be asking yourself- "What is Kernelcon?" It's a Conference of kernels! You might then
ask yourself, "The Linux kernel?" or "popcorn kernels?" maybe both! 

According to the Kernelcon site: 
<p>
Kernelcon is the result of many motivated information security professionals
 who recognized the opportunity to create an awesome security conference in Omaha.
 The idea for Kernelcon started within the local DEF CON Group, DC402, with lots of
 help from other members of other local security groups such as NebraskaCERT and OWASP.
 We are inspired by many other conferences including DEF CON, DerbyCon, ShmooCon, etc.,
 and wanted to bring those same experiences to the Mid-West here in Omaha.
</p>

I've been to a handful of conferences in the past- SecTOR, BSides Toronto, BSides Rochester, Shmoocon, and SplunkLive!, and
I must say that Kernelcon definitely takes the cake!

Why did it take the cake? This year's Kernelcon was the first ever Kernelcon. How I heard about it was on
 [Infosec-conferences.com](https://infosec-conferences.com/), a really handy site with information on infosec conferences
 and meetups around the world.

Kernelcon caught my eye specifically because of the whole popcorn theme and the fact that it was being held in an area I've never been to.
I wanted to do a mix of education and tourism so Kernelcon definitely fit the bill!

<h2> What Kernelcon did right </h2>

- The conference itself was packed with lots of informative and entertaining talks.

![Good, wholesome, entertainment](/assets/kernelcon2019/1%20(6).jpg)
Good, wholesome, entertainment!

![So wholesome!](/assets/kernelcon2019/1%20(12).jpg)
So wholesome.

- There were more than enough seats for everyone without crowding or people standing to watch.

- Free popcorn with various seasonings, water, coffee, and even ice cream. Score!

- Two lanyards- one black, and one yellow were included. The black one (on the badge by default) indicated that
the person wearing it is okay with having their picture taken. The yellow one indicated the person did not 
want their picture taken or displayed anywhere. This was really handy and much appreciated!

- The talks were held in rooms adjacent to each other. Very convenient!

- There was even a fitness center (that was part of the conference) but I don't think anyone used... I did grab a few water bottles
for later use, though!

- The trinkets and gear included with the ticket was great. A laptop bag containing stickers, bookmarks, information 
pamphlets, a tshirt, a popsicle stick for the training session I signed up for, and pens were included.

All the gear.

- Holding the party on the first night and a limited amount of drink tickets. This is ideal as most people can loosen up a bit and get to know each other better
 before the conference is over! It was also held at a time (like 7pm) that wasn't too late, so most people could get enough sleep
and attend the next-day conference activities without too much issue. They also held a "Whose Slide is it Anyway" where a bunch of people sign up to present slides
they've never seen before! Hilarity ensued!

![Slides](/assets/kernelcon2019/1%20(9).jpg)
Much wow.

- There were a variety of activities- classes on various topics- IOT hacking, building a microcontroller, drone building, 
network analysis, webapp pentesting, IR- also a WiFi fox and hound challenge, 
CTF, resume village, lockpick village, and even a chillout room with video games!

I signed up for an IOT hacking course, it was fun!

- Free parking spots (about 150) across the street, although I didn't have access to a car during the conference. Here's a picture of the KGB:

<h2> What could have been improved on </h2>

While there is always room for improvement, I can't find many things to point out that could be improved upon. I
really enjoyed going to this conference.

- More vendors. It would have been nice to make more contacts (and get free stuff haha). I had a great time chatting with the 
[TrustedSec](https://www.trustedsec.com/) people!

![TrustedSec!](/assets/kernelcon2019/1%20(4).jpg)
TrustedSec!

- Someone had mentioned this at the end of the conference, but the chillout room could have used more space.
- Have the conference run during the weekend- so I don't have to take more days off than I need to, hahah. Although during this trip I took 3 days off work 
so I could take in Omaha/Nebraska. 


I really enjoyed Kernelcon, and really can't wait to attend the next one!
