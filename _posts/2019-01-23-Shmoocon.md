*Last updated: 27 January 2019*

Last weekend, I went on a plane to Washington DC, USA to attend [Shmoocon](https://shmoocon.org)!
I'd like to diverge from the usual discourse on tools, ideas revolving around infosec, and talk about my experiences with Shmoocon and the events surrounding my trip.

<h2> What is Shmoocon? </h2> 

It's a hacker conference that caters to anyone interested or vested in the information security realm. 
According to the Shmoocon moose guide, the aim of Shmoocon is to support "the free and open exchange of information", 
to "foster the exchange of ideas among attendees and think the community benefits from inclusiveness."
They "are committed to proving a friendly, lively, and welcoming environment for all".

I first heard about the conference after doing some research on conferences around the world- this led me to come to the
conclusion that it would be a great idea to fuel my interest in traveling to new and exciting places while furthering 
my knowledge and learning in the field of infosec (although I will be travelling to the Caribbean in a few months but not attend a conference...)
Shmoocon was a great first time going out of the country and my comfort zone!


<h2> Tickets </h2> 

You may be wondering why I devoted an entire section of my blog post to tickets.
If you are, read on. If you are not, read anyway for some stats!


Tickets were fairly difficult to get- in my opinion- as the number of potential attendees overtake the number of available tickets. There were 
about 2200 tickets up for sale and the exact number of people who wanted to get tickets is a bit hard to determine, but there are some
stats on the [Shmoocon site](https://shmoocon.org/2019/01/03/yearly-ticket-sales-stats-2019/). 


The indicator that ticket sales ended so quickly was the amount of time it took to sell [1465 tickets in each round](https://shmoocon.org/2019/01/03/yearly-ticket-sales-stats-2019/)- 
6.78 seconds (round 1 for 500 tickets), 9.01 seconds (round 2 for 650 tickets), 3.88 seconds (round 3 for 315 tickets).

If you mention "F5" in terms of conferences, people will know which con you're referring to because of the minimal time you get to reserve to buy a ticket!

Round 3 was the final round of tickets and I managed to snag one of the 315 tickets for sale! Lucky me. I first tried to get tickets during round 2 but took too long!
I think I took around half a minute to go through the whole process, and by the time I completed the initial process, tickets were all sold out.

How the ticket reservation process works is that there will be a twitter/site announcement that ticket sales will happen on a particular date and time
where you will be presented a landing page to access. You will have to be quick on the draw to get a ticket! If you are lucky enough to reserve one, you'll get an opportunity
to enter your name and email address. An email should arrive in a few hours with a link to allow you to purchase your ticket(s).
In addition to how reserving a ticket works, I won't go into more detail from there to add a little mystery into how the process works :)

I suppose my experience in my current day job prepared me in obtaining a ticket.
Once you've failed in obtaining a ticket in a round, you'll know what to expect for the next one.  While you'll be in the know, 
"[it will take [others] a moment to realize that [others are] about to make a 180 degree turn at speed, but you will be ready for it.
 Brace for the Gs, and fast heel-toe work.](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas/quotes/)" 
 
The ticket price of USD 150/CAD 200 is a lot more accessible than some conferences- [SecTor](https://sector.ca) comes to mind, where a full conference ticket can cost up to USD 1084/CAD 1449.
Granted, most people who attend SecTor might be sponsored by their company to go, or they might attend the Expo (as I've been doing the past 3 years) for a much more discounted
price (think 2 digit pricing or free, with a discount code).


<h2> Talk Highlights </h2>

The conference was definitely right up my alley as most of the talks I sat on were engaging and entertaining. The presenters were articulate and had a good grounding of
the subject matter as they were able to answer any technical questions the audience had. 

There were 3 days' worth of conferences (2 half days and 1 full day) with the first day being 1 track called "One Track Mind" and the 2nd and 3rd days split up into 3 tracks-
 "build it", "belay it", and "bring it on!".


According to the [call for papers page](https://shmoocon.org/call-for-papers/) on the Shmoocon site, the "One Track Mind" track includes 
"plenary presentations of broad technical interest" where each presenter has approximately 20 minutes to talk about any topic under
the information security spectrum. The "Build It" track consists of talks regarding "creating inventive software and hardware",
 while "Belay It" describes talks that are "cutting edge defensive solutions
to contemporary problems", and "bring it on!" refers to "open discussion of technology and security topics".

From One Track Mind, I particularly enjoyed "Weapons of Text Destruction" and "What's the Latest 411 on 419s?" from the fireside talks series.

In [*Weapons of Text Destruction*](https://shmoocon.org/speakers#firetalk4) presented by Jared Stroud, he describes utilizing the VI iMproved (vim) text editor
to perform a plethora that I personally was not aware of before attending the talk. Apparently you can use vim as a keylogger, AND also execute python scripts
without invoking the interpreter! A description of built-in plugins, user-defined functions, and subsystems are mentioned. Very, very, interesting!

I also enjoyed [Ray \[Redacted\] (sic)'s](https://shmoocon.org/speakers#firetalk6) talk on 419 scams where he discusses having interacted with a Bitcoin scammer
utilizing bitcoin bait to entice them into trying to deal with him. Incredibly interesting talk, highly recommended!

PS: you can find these recorded talks on the Shmoocon site [here](link pending).




<h2> Goodies and Vendors </h2> 

There were lots of goodies to be had!
Upon presentation of my barcode and registration, I was given a badge and orange Shmoocon bag. It was filled with a few goodies, to my delight.
Despite my bag already having some goodies inside, by the end of the first day this happened:

![ball](/assets/shmoocon2019/shmooball.png)

This is great as it takes the guesswork from having to go to every booth to get their stickers, pens, buttons, etc. as it would allow us to do more productive things, like
*actually* speaking to the vendors and interacting with them.

Well, the vendors were still talked up and they gave me more goodies hahaha!
I learned quite a bit about each vendor through interacting with with most of the vendors there. Here is a few examples of my interactions:

[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/): the Hipchat people. They sold their product and now use Slack chat. Funny enough, the Slack booth was right beside them. They had a really cool watermelon sticker!

[Slack](https://slack.com/): the company behind the chat application. Fun group of people to chat with! I got more stickers!

[EFF](https://eff.org): The Electronic Frontier Foundation. I donated for a nice lapel pin for my collection and some stickers for my work laptop.

[NetSPI](https://www.netspi.com/): I recall asking about what they do but ultimately nothing came out of that interaction, but I got some stickers from them.

[No starch Press](https://nostarch.com/): I talked to one of the editors and mentioned I've been reading *Malware Data Science* which I obtained via the online store
during a Black Friday deal. I also obtained some nice pins and stickers from them.

[Black Hills Security](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/): I obtained a fairly decent t-shirt from them. Real nice people. Stickers and buttons were also obtained.

[SANS Technology Institute](https://www.sans.org/): I discussed with the person there how I participated in their Holiday Hack Challenge. Also inquired about any malware analysis programs. They
didn't have any stickers, but I did get a course guide! :)

[Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html): I didn't get a chance to talk to them but really like their logo. I grabbed a sticker.

[Trimarc](https://www.trimarcsecurity.com/): They had a challenge coin event where they give you a plastic coin with text on the top of the coin and text on the bottom which I was able to decode the top text, but
didn't get around to deciphering/decoding the bottom text. The top text was ROT-13 encoded. Personally, I like to encode non-sensitive information with ROT-26, hahaha.

[Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/): They have APIs that can allow programmers to implement 2FA on SMS as an example. Really neat bunch of people! I got an Authy sticker and
a t-shirt from them.

[King & Union](https://www.kingandunion.com/): Based in Alexandria, VA, they had a card that said they would donate $2 for every sign-up for their service known as *Avalon*. Their service is a way to visualize
threats in a mind-map that allows the threat analyst to better observe and make any connections that they might otherwise miss without a visualization. A very interesting tool
that reminds me a bit of Threatconnect with Maltego but with many differences and features optimized for graphic mapping, sharing, and visualization. I met the guy who worked on it-
Aaron, who seemed like a pretty cool dude. They didn't have stickers, though.

[Warcollar](http://warcollar.com/): They showed me a curious little device called the [*DopeScope*](http://warcollar.com/products/dopescope.html) that
 allows a hobbyist or someone on an engagement to determine what WiFi networks are in range! 
 It uses a directional antenna so based on where you're aiming the scope, you'll be able to determine where a wireless access point (WAP)
is located! Very nifty! Also, I got more stickers.

The NSA "booth": which was just a phone/tablet charging station. There were no suits or federal agents around, but I certainly did not want to try it as seen in this picture:
![Good try, though.](/assets/shmoocon2019/NSA.png)

There were also a couple booths with arcade games but they were always busy whenever I walked by, so I decided not to approach them.

Also, other booths I might have forgotten to list here. It was great meeting and interacting with them!

[Barcode Shmarcode](https://twitter.com/Shmoo_Shmarcode): There were some really interesting entries this year! I saw a motorized plushie moose climbing a rope, another moose in a landscape setting climbing a mountain,
climbing equipment with the barcode on it, and a physical bump map of an expedition to "Mt. Hackmore"! They didn't have stickers, but I did meet one of the people behind the 
event who was also in the same Discord chat group (TMHC) I'm in as well. Hello, @ForgottenSec!


<h2> Conference Interaction </h2>  


Personally, I did not know anyone at the conference (except for maybe one person who advertised they would be there in an online forum/discord server called TMHC)
and was a bit of a leap out of my comfort levels. In terms of the Jung personality test, I rate in between an "E" and "I" (extrovert vs. introvert) 
from one of the four personality domains.

Therefore, it was slightly difficullt for me to make new contacts and meet new people. 
Since it seemed everyone knew each other and only interacted with each other, it was hard for me to put my foot in the metaphorical door and meet people I've never met before.

With the above information in mind, note that I did talk to most of the vendors there (definitely not for the free stickers and trinkets).
I learned a bit about the company, what they do, and some information on the person I talked to's professional life. 
I felt I made some good connections with some of the vendors as we also exchanged business cards.

There were instances where I rubbed shoulders with other conference goers at the Saturday night party, where I "danced" on the stage with others and also interacted with
a few people. The open bar was a plus, too! I drank lots of delicious Stella cider.
At one point there were conga lines. I participated in 2 conga lines and a few "dance"-offs*. The conga lines were great!

<h2> OPSEC </h2>  

OPSEC, or [Operations Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security), refers to keeping individual pieces of potentially relevant (or not)
 information or data secure from adversaries.
In the case of the conference being one for hackers and the like, I took some precautions to safeguard my belongings and data.

In retrospect, I could say I was successful in my endeavour to safeguard myself and my data. A little too successful.

One of the things I did to safeguard my information was not bringing my laptop. 
An extension of my toolkit, my laptop was safely tucked away in the living room at home in Canada.
Bringing it across the border might have added some delay to my travel as more electronics add more headache to the clearance process.

I also turned off bluetooth and didn't use the WiFi network provided by the conference- the roaming plan I added to my phone did the trick. However, I had to watch my usage
as it was only 1 GB of data. I don't consume much data on my phone to begin with, but it was nice to stay in touch with people while I was outside of the hotel.

Oh yes, I did connect to the hotel's wireless network, however, I was a little weary about [potential attacks on that network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DarkHotel).

There was also a decoy wallet I carried with me that, in retrospect, might not have been too effective as I didn't make it seem like a [convincing fake](http://tacticalintelligence.net/blog/decoy-wallet.htm).

It had a few reciepts, a single bus ticket, and a Canadian $5 inside- a sobering reminder of my past, but wouldn't have been too convincing to a would-be mugger.

For starters, the wallet I created would work if I am in the situation where I could throw the wallet behind the mugger and run in the opposite direction to safety.
In every other case, like if the mugger demands I stay, the wallet might not be convincing enough.

In the future, wallet 2.0 will look a little more convincing. Stay tuned!

I also utilized common sense/safe practices with being outside in a not-too-familiar city by not staying out too long after dark,
walking in high-traffic areas, and being aware of my surroundings.
I did, however, keep in mind that the city was experiencing *extremely atypical weather patterns* aka really cold weather (that reminded me of home!!) so most people
would not have been outside (or for a while). Walking outside for even 10 minutes was a fairly daunting task.


<h2> Fun and Excitement Outside the Con </h2> 

Aside from con-going, it's a good idea to take in the area and experience things that you might not find elsewhere. In this section I'll describe some things I did in the Washington and Alexandria (Virginia) areas.

I...
- Walked around Washington (sorta kinda, it was fairly cold (-26C or -14F wind chill on one day) on most days I was there- just like home!).
- Participated in a complimentary happy hour at my hotel, met a curious fellow who was getting into the legal industry.
- Took a train to "old town" in Alexandria, VA.
- Attended a couple museums, the inventors' hall of fame, and an art center that was converted from a torpedo factory during WWII.
- Went on self-guided or guided tours at said museums and the Pentagon.
- Lucked out by visiting Alexandria during restaurant week (January 18-27)
- Ate lots of delicious seafood, sandwiches, burgers, curry, sushi.
- Rode on a [free trolley](https://www.dashbus.com/ride-dash/king-street-trolley) in Alexandria's old town (with historical facts being announced before each stop!) several times.
- Added some pins I collected during the trip to my collection.

One time during my stay at the hotel, a friend asked me what I was up to and I replied, "chatting and watching adult TV"
To which I took a picture of the television and sent them this:

<h2> Final Thoughts </h2> 

A bit of fun was had during this trip. While I didn't participate too much in the activities like Hack Fortress, lock picking, or CTF, I did enjoy sitting in on the talks and
interacting with the vendors and fellow conference-goers.

The atmosphere was a lot more relaxed than some of the other conferences I've been to, and really enjoyed rubbing shoulders with likeminded individuals.

I will try to attend again next year!






*I seriously cannot dance for my life and should take lessons someday. I can do a mean [lawn mower/shopping cart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_NwKh-P00s), though.
