**DNS traffic is inherently insecure.** All DNS queries and responses are sent and received via UDP traffic in the clear, so it is possible for someone
sniffing this metadata-like traffic to infer from DNS traffic what kind of sites/things the user is browsing.

I recently (OK, last year) installed Simple DNSCrypt (a GUI platform that makes DNSCrypt easier to manage) and wanted to determine if 
my DNS traffic was being encrypted properly.

This article will confirm if DNSCrypt lives up to its name.

  As you can see from the above image, the wireshark packet capture illustrates unencrypted DNS traffic with a following of the UDP stream. You can tell the user (me) is requesting a resource from reddit.com.

Very cool (but a little privacy-hindering). You'd be able to infer that I was on the site (presumably) looking at cat gifs or browsing the programmer humour subreddit.

Pictured above is the same traffic but encrypted. You wouldn't be able to tell what kind of site(s) I made DNS requests for!

Therefore, in terms of the nitty-gritty packet data, DNSCrypt does in fact work.

So if you've got a nosy-and-tech-savvy-SO that sniffs your web traffic and might find out that you're buying them a birthday or holiday-themed present,
this tool is for you! Or if you're browsing particular sites that might be censored DNS-wise by your local government, this tool might work as well.

Please be aware this tool *only* encrypts your DNS traffic. HTTP/any other kind traffic isn't encrypted, so you will have to use a different tool (like VPN) to encrypt the rest.

You can obtain Simple DNSCrypt from [here](https://www.simplednscrypt.org/)

Pretty neat, huh?
