While on social media I found a neat-looking recipe about cookies, yum yum!!
The ingredients went as follows:
- butter
- sugar
FULL RECIPE: https[:]//EZ-ANIME[dot]COM

What?

My initial reaction was "this is a phishing site" since it had nothing to do with anime. I was taken aback with what I found...

My next reaction was to look up the website without going to the website. The first step was to go to DuckDuckGo and search for the website. "ez-anime.com". I couldn't find anything until the middle of the page-

I didn't access the link just yet. I opened up a virtual machine to inspect the website with a tool called [wheregoes](https://wheregoes.com) and had the tool tell me where it would go. It's very handy for redirect links as well:

Satisfied that it didn't redirect to some whacky site I accessed it on the virtual machine. Turns out it leads to a webmail login:

Port 2096 was a bit peculiar to me, so I looked it up and turns out it's the default port for the CPanel SSL Web mail:

"Okay", I thought. Let's see where this link over port 80 goes:

Turns out it is a recipe site, but you may notice it seems a bit plain. There are links to recipes but it doesn't tell you who the author is, what their inspiration for the site/food is, or even a nice title for the site. Just "Our Recipes". Who is "our"?

I eventually found the recipe for the cookies without clicking on the original link in the social media post.
You'll notice that the recipe is very to-the-point and doesn't offer a backstory like most recipe sites.

My best guess is that based on several telltale signs surrounding this site, such as:
- No attribution
- The recipes are to-the-point
- Website feels very generic
- The name of the web domain, "ez-anime". There is no anime.

This is likely an AI-generated domain.

Briefly looking at the source code of the cookies recipe and the homepage, I can see there is Search Engine Optimization (SEO) applied. I will touch upon this in a bit:

"What are AI generated domains?" you may ask? They're domains that are generated by script that uses the power of artificially intelligent systems to mimic the behaviour of humans with natural language processing (NLP) to create websites and blogs. Basically, there are people deploying software that can create websites en-masse to achieve a certain goal. Whether it's to prove a point, spread disinformation, or "game" search engines, it can be a point to make that these sort of websites can range from harmless (like ez-anime[dot].com) to harmful (AI spreading disinformation).

Check out this ([*The Verge* article from 2019](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/19063562/ai-text-generation-spam-marketing-seo-fractl-grover-google)).

Essentially the article states that one of the goals of "endless AI-generated spam" can be used to "spread political disinformation", but "there's another target that's equally plausible and potentially more lucrative: gaming Google.", where the owners behind these sites are trying to create as many AI-generated websites as possible to get as many page hits they can so they could generate click or ad revenue:

"The history of SEO certainly supports this prediction. It’s always been a cat and mouse game, with unscrupulous players trying whatever methods they can to attract as many eyeballs as possible while gatekeepers like Google sort the wheat from the chaff."

The goal? Profit. That is why I mentioned the usage of SEO in that recipe site- the use of keywords and phrases injected into the site so search engines can correlate a user's Google or DDG searches and have it appear at the top of the search results if a user searches for those words. By being close or at the top of the results, the owner of the website can maximize their ad revenue.

The article I linked from The Verge is from 2019. AI-generated content has gotten better since then. Instances such as ([Midjourney AI](https://www.midjourney.com/home/)) can illustrate the power of AI-generated art. ([There are also AI that can generate stories](https://rigorousthemes.com/blog/best-ai-story-generators/)) based on what you tell it.  


The Verge article does offer an interest end-narrative, however, instead of a doomsday "technology will evolve so rapidly that we can't control it" scenario we can seek to harness it and use it for our bidding:

"The end-game of all this could be even more interesting though. AI-text generation is advancing in quality extremely quickly, and experts in the field think it could lead to some incredible breakthroughs. After all, if we can create a program that can read and generate text with human-level accuracy, it could gorge itself on the internet and become the ultimate AI assistant... Because if you’ve created an AI that can generate factually-correct text that’s indistinguishable from content written by humans, why bother with the humans at all?"

I'll stick to poking fun at empty shelled recipe sites for now, thanks.
