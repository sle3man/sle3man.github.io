title: Passed! A Tale of Certification Woes and Woos

Earlier this month, I managed to pass the CompTIA CSA+ (now called CySa+) exam! It was the result of about half a year of studying after passing the Network+ exam. I have since doubled the amount of IT certifications I possess.

I felt a bit of burnout after taking the Network+ but pulled my bootstraps and notified my boss of my intent to take the next exam of my choice.
So I sent an email in, and was asked to give a little information about the exam seeing how it was just released earlier in the year
and not too many people were aware of it.

After I sent a little blurb (about 2 pages long) about the certification, the target audience, the cost (which became 
pricier after the time of my write-up) I waited for approval. I figured since I have a healthy mix
of work experience and know-how/hands-on experience from personal projects/activities and graduate school 
I would be a shoo-in to take the exam.

To my delight, I was approved to study and take the exam. I had to order a study guide off Amazon
to be able to study/review! Typically my company would have resources for a multitude of certs, but not this one.

I studied maybe a couple pages (think 1-5) every few days. Don't tell anyone but I didn't really study until mid-December...
After a few months of lazing about, a horrible sense of dread became apparent- my Security+ certification I obtained in
February 2015 was going to expire soon!

I suppose this was a bit of an oversight when I decided to study for and take the Network+ exam in August. 
It dawned upon me that I had to take the CSA+ exam or risk losing my cert! I dialed the studying from a 2 to probably a 7 (Not a 8 or higher
since I didn't pull an all-nighter or crammed it all in one night, no siree) and finished my study in early February.

Determined to write the exam, I tried to book at the usual place for my exams with no luck- the ideal timeslots were all taken up!
So instead of an easygoing 15-20 minute one-way drive, it turned into a 40 minute drive. This was not a great deal, but when I got
there the exam center was horribly administered- the staff had technical issues in the form of not being able to get their camera
working to take snapshots of people for the documentation and among other things which made me and the other exam candidates take
their exam later than usual. I suppose it didn't affect much as I had that day off but it was 30 minutes of my day gone.

During the test I was presented with a series of questions a la usual format that closed book CompTIA exam offers- a couple application questions to start,
and a ton of multiple choice questions to follow. I powered through the application questions as best I could- I'm pretty sure
I made some errors or omissions here and there on the application questions but not too glaringly bad. There was one part
I wasn't too sure about though... The multiple choice questions were a different beast. Most of the questions were
scenario-based which required reading paragraph-long questions and answering them with multiple choice responses that were
a doozy to read through. I must note that during the exam there were kids (like 6) outside the room I was doing the test in
that were very loud within earshot. Multiple Google reviews of the establishment have confirmed that and while the administrators
claimed to do something about it, my ears were still assaulted by the vocalizations of these kids.

I've noticed, and other test-takers have noticed that the CSA+ exam tests a particular part of your knowledge and practical experience
with cybersecurity. I thought it was a great exam with a good mix of questions testing both. Where Security+ tests the "what you know
about network security", CSA+ tests the "what you know about cybersecurity" and also "how you do cybersecurity"
to a certain, vendor-neutral extent. I've heard that the CompTIA CASP tests "why we do what we do in cybersecurity" 
so my interest is a bit piqued.

Ultimately, I let out a huuuge sigh of relief when I got to the end and the words "CONGRATULATIONS, YOU PASSED!" flashed on the screen.
Elated, I walked out of the half-filled test-taker room and went to the test centre administrators to receive a copy of my results
that displays my score and the exam objective categories in which I incorrectly answered.

They told me there was a printer error and to contact CompTIA directly, so I did just that. 

After my exam and interaction with the administrators I contacted my friend to see if he was available for
some celebratory chicken wings (For some strange reason I picked up an affinity for wings laterly...) but received no response.
Later I found out they read my message but misinterpreted thinking I wanted them to be at a certain location in 15 minutes from
the time they read my message! No, I wanted them to reply saying if they were available or not by 15 minutes.

They told me that the results will be sent to my email address. I'm still waiting on my results, though.

Either way, after leaving the exam center I went for some celebratory Buffalo Wild Wings. I ordered a double order which included
2 pounds of wings (actually I don't think they advertised it as 2 pounds, as there were 4 flavours and only 4 wings/flavour)
and one of the flavours was *Blazin'*, which was the hottest flavour on their menu made with ghost pepper. It also had a little
sticker on the box saying that it was a "skin irritant" and to "thoroughly wash with water" if the sauce made contact with skin or
the eyes.

After acquiring the wings I put a couple jackets on the package and wrapped up the bag to ensure the wings were still hot,
as I had a 45 minute drive ahead of me. When I returned home, I ate the wings while watching a Japanese drama called Nodame
Cantabile. The hottest flavour was yummy, but sooo hot!

It was a great time, indeed. Did I also mention I passed the exam by 10 points? Granted you require 83% (750/900) to pass, but 
even if you're a single point under 750 you still fail!
